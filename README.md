# dftp-2
ftp server client made in python using socket prograaming after some time and testing i will write how you can use this properly like what commands are valid or not and all and this is totally CLI based ftp, "d" there because it is made by darwin means ME.. : )

USAGE:
0. frst install require module in requirement.txt using command "pip install -r requirement.txt" and you must have python in your pc 
commands = [ls,pwd,cd,send filepath+name ,get filepath+name]
1.server has no control means from server you cant run any commands 
2. client can run commands in their own system using "!" ,example if you want to see client's current dir then write "!ls"
3.for server side navigation you can use commands normally
